# Real-time Risk Stratification Model: Clinical Data to Patient Outcomes
This project uses both statistical and machine learning models to identifying high-risk CNS patients and predict patient outcomes.
# Real-Time Risk Stratification Model for High-Risk CNS Patients

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time risk stratification model to predict patient outcomes for high-risk Central Nervous System (CNS) patients. The model will leverage both statistical and machine learning techniques to identify at-risk patients based on clinical data, enabling early intervention and improved patient care.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Ingest and preprocess clinical data efficiently.
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Models:** Utilize logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and deep learning models.
- **Explainability & Interpretability:** Use SHAP, LIME, and feature importance analysis.
- **Deployment-Ready Pipeline:** Designed for real-time risk scoring in clinical settings.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensures compliance with HIPAA and GDPR standards.

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Data:** Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare data.
   ```sh
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```
2. **Train & Evaluate Models:** Select and train models for outcome prediction.
   ```sh
   python model_selection.py
   ```
3. **Deploy the Pipeline:** Run the pipeline to process real-time data.
   ```sh
   python pipeline_architecture.py
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning models)
